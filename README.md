# Fast-Settling-High-Gain-Op-Amp-for-ADC
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and analysis of a high-gain, high-speed two-stage operational amplifier (Op-Amp) using Cadence Virtuoso. The Op-Amp is designed with a telescopic cascode topology in the first stage to enhance overall gain by increasing output impedance while keeping power consumption low. A common-source amplifier is added as the second stage to improve output swing, overcoming the limited swing of the cascode structure. For precise biasing, a high-swing cascode current mirror is implemented using a 100µA master current source, ensuring accurate current mirroring across the circuit. Stability is a key challenge in multistage amplifiers, so Miller compensation is employed with a zero-nulling resistor (Rz) to eliminate the right-half-plane (RHP) zero, significantly improving the phase margin to 70.8°, making the amplifier stable.

Through extensive simulations, the Op-Amp achieves an open-loop DC gain of 77 dB, a low power consumption of 0.3232 mW, and robust performance across a temperature range of 0-75°C, ensuring reliability in various operating conditions. Additionally, the closed-loop gain is approximately 2X, with a unity gain bandwidth (UGB) of 89.625 MHz, making it well-suited for high-speed, high-accuracy applications like switched capacitor pipeline Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). The simulations validate the design's effectiveness, demonstrating the Op-Amp’s suitability for precision analog signal processing.
